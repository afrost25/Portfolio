                    <p>
                        I am a Software Engineer at EduPoint Educational Systems with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
                        from Arizona State University. My passion lies in reverse engineering, low-level systems, and bridging 
                        these concepts with modern web technologies. With experience in embedded systems and web development, 
                        I aim to create innovative tools that support software analysis and research.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       My passion for programming began in high school, where I taught myself Java to create Minecraft
                       mods. With no computer science courses available at my school, I relied on books and resources
                       from my local library. This early curiosity grew into a commitment to pursue Computer Science,
                       beginning at Lane Community College and later transferring to Arizona State University.

                    <p>
                        After graduating, I began my career as an intern at EduPoint administrators was promoted to 
                        Software Engineer I within six months. I thrive on solving complex challenges and
                        contributing to projects that improve educational outcomes for schools across the 
                        country.

                        I am continually expanding my skills in modern web technologies and UI/UX to become
                        a full-stack software engineer. I am contributing to reverse engineer and low-level 
                        development community by building web technology solutions that prove useful
                        in software analysis and research.
