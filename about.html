            <h2>Short Summary:</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Software Engineer at EduPoint Educational Systems with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
                from Arizona State University. My passion lies in reverse engineering, low-level systems, and bridging 
                these concepts with modern web technologies. With experience in embedded systems and web development, 
                I aim to create innovative tools that support software analysis and research.

            <p>
                My passion for programming began in high school, where I taught myself Java to create Minecraft
                mods. With no computer science courses available at my school, I relied on books and resources
                from my local library. This early curiosity grew into a commitment to pursue Computer Science,
                beginning at Lane Community College and later transferring to Arizona State University.

                I am continually expanding my skills in modern web technologies and UI/UX to become
                a full-stack software engineer. I am contributing to reverse engineer and low-level 
                development community by building web technology solutions that prove useful
                in software analysis and research.
